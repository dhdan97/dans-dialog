# Dan's Dialog
**A GatsbyJS Project that acts as my Portfolio and Blog.**

Created using GatsbyJS, uses Contentful as a headless CMS, and hosted with Netlify.

Still a **Work In Progress**, but you can view the site at: https://bespoke-chebakia-7be4de.netlify.app/

## Installation

Would you like to run this locally? Here's what you need to do:

**Note: Locally, the blog content will be unable to be rendered due to secrets not being available.**
- Git clone/fork this repository into your local system.
- Navigate to the root file using your terminal.
- Install dependencies with ``npm install``.
- To run a development server, do ``gatsby develop``.
- To view the local website, go to http://localhost:8000/ on your browser.
